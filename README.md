# [3RWW EPA SUSTAIN App](https://civicmapper.github.io/3rww-sustain-app)

This mapping tool is for the exploration and download of 3 Rivers Wet Weather's (3RWW) 2013 results from the EPA System Urban Stormwater Treatment and Analysis Integration (SUSTAIN) model for Allegheny County. For more information about 3RWW, visit http://3riverswetweather.org/

This open-source web mapping tool is based on the <a href="https://github.com/WPRDC/property-information-extractor">WPRDC's Property Information Extractor</a>, which was based on Chris Whong's <a href="https://github.com/chriswhong/plutoplus" >plutoplus</a>. In adapting those tools for this project, we made some big changes under the hood. To utilize ArcGIS Server map services, this version swaps out the <a href="https://carto.com/docs/carto-engine/carto-js/" >CARTO JS javascript library</a> used by those tools for the <a href="https://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet">Esri-Leaflet javascript library</a>.</p><br>

<p>This is a work-in-progress. Please send questions, concerns, or feature requests for this software to <a href="mailto:3rww@civicmapper.com">3rww@civicmapper.com</a>...or, file an issue or submit a pull request here.
